# Security architecture factsheet

This factsheet gives legal teams, IT leads, and compliance officers a structured overview of the Subsumio security architecture, data lifecycle, and operational controls.

> Audience: Managing partners, legal operations, DPOs, CISOs, and procurement/security review teams.

---

## 1) System objective (user-facing)

Subsumio is designed so law firms can process highly sensitive legal documents with:

- strong confidentiality and integrity controls,
- verifiable auditability,
- clear role-based access,
- and predictable EU-compliant operations.

The security model is built to protect both daily operations (uploads, search, drafting) and high-stakes workflows (evidence review, deadlines, legal strategy).

## 2) Security principles

- **Security-by-design**: controls are part of product architecture, not bolted on.
- **Least privilege**: users and services get only required permissions.
- **Defense in depth**: network, identity, application, data, and operations layers.
- **Auditability first**: high-risk actions are logged and traceable.
- **Data minimization**: process only what is required for legal workflows.
- **EU-first residency**: data processing and storage anchored in EU infrastructure.

## 3) High-level architecture

### Layer model

1. **Edge & transport layer**
   - TLS 1.3 enforced for client-to-platform and service-to-service transport.
   - Modern cipher suites and HSTS-style hardening.

2. **Identity & access layer**
   - Workspace-scoped identity.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for read/write/export operations.
   - Enterprise support for SSO/SAML where required.

3. **Application layer**
   - Permission checks at action boundaries.
   - Workflow-scoped validation for uploads, processing, and retrieval.
   - Strong request/context separation across tenants.

4. **Data & storage layer**
   - Encryption at rest (AES-256 class controls).
   - Segregated logical data domains for matters, documents, metadata, and logs.
   - Backup and restore strategy aligned to RPO/RTO targets.

5. **Observability & governance layer**
   - Immutable-style audit trails for security-relevant actions.
   - Monitoring, anomaly detection, and incident response workflows.

### Data lifecycle map (security checkpoints)

| Stage      | What happens                               | Primary control focus                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Ingestion  | Files are accepted and validated           | Type/size validation, secure transport     |
| Processing | OCR/extraction and semantic transformation | Execution safeguards, isolation boundaries |
| Indexing   | Retrieval structures are built             | Data integrity, access scoping             |
| Usage      | Search/analysis/drafting operations        | RBAC enforcement, source traceability      |
| Retention  | Policy-driven storage duration             | Governance controls, reviewability         |
| Deletion   | Controlled cleanup execution               | Authorized deletion + audit evidence       |

## 4) Core user flows and security controls

### A) Beginner flow (single legal professional)

1. Upload case documents.
2. Platform extracts and structures content.
3. User asks legal questions and inspects references.

Controls in path:

- secure upload channel (TLS),
- file validation and controlled processing pipeline,
- role checks for document visibility,
- action logging for traceability.

### B) Standard team flow (law firm collaboration)

1. Partner assigns matter access to team members.
2. Team reviews evidence and generated outputs.
3. Exports are restricted by role/policy.

Controls in path:

- RBAC enforcement by matter/workspace,
- optional approval steps for high-impact actions,
- audit trail of assignment, edits, and exports.

### C) Power-user flow (enterprise governance)

1. Identity federation and centralized user lifecycle.
2. Security/compliance review and periodic control checks.
3. Forensics-ready logging and policy-based operations.

Controls in path:

- SSO/SAML integration,
- centralized access governance,
- compliance-aligned reporting surfaces.

## 5) Data model and lifecycle

### Primary data domains

- **Identity data**: users, roles, workspace membership.
- **Matter data**: case metadata, participants, legal references.
- **Document data**: originals, derivatives, extracted text/chunks.
- **Operational data**: jobs, statuses, queue state, retries.
- **Audit data**: security events, access events, export/change logs.

### Data lifecycle (simplified)

1. **Ingestion**: files received and validated.
2. **Processing**: text extraction/OCR/chunk generation.
3. **Indexing**: semantic retrieval structures created.
4. **Usage**: search, analysis, drafting with source references.
5. **Retention**: policies applied according to workspace governance.
6. **Deletion/cleanup**: controlled removal with traceable actions.

## 6) Encryption model

- **In transit**: TLS 1.3 for all client and service communication.
- **At rest**: AES-256 class encryption for persisted data.
- **Secrets handling**: credentials/keys managed via protected runtime configuration and strict access boundaries.

## 7) Access control architecture

### RBAC baseline

Typical capability boundaries:

- **Admin**: workspace governance, members, policy operations.
- **Lawyer/Editor**: case and document processing, analysis, drafting.
- **Reviewer**: read/comment/review depending on policy.
- **Restricted role**: limited visibility for least-privilege collaboration.

### Access governance patterns

- default-deny mindset for sensitive actions,
- role checks on view/edit/export,
- explicit workspace and matter scoping,
- predictable permission propagation and revocation.

## 8) Auditability and compliance evidence

Security-relevant events are logged for compliance and investigation use-cases:

- authentication and membership changes,
- permission changes,
- document intake and export actions,
- sensitive workflow actions and status changes.

Audit goals:

- support internal controls,
- support external audits,
- preserve chain-of-custody style evidence for legal workflows.

### Control matrix (quick reference)

| Control area           | Practical implementation direction              | Verification signal                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Transport security     | TLS 1.3 on client/service paths                 | Endpoint checks, config review               |
| Access governance      | RBAC + least privilege + scoped membership      | Access review and role test results          |
| Data protection        | Encryption at rest and segmented domains        | Storage/config evidence                      |
| Workflow security      | Validation gates on upload/process/export paths | QA/security test outcomes                    |
| Audit integrity        | Security-relevant event logging                 | Audit log inspection and traceability checks |
| Operational resilience | Monitoring, alerting, and recovery routines     | Incident drills, recovery evidence           |

## 9) Compliance posture (overview)

- GDPR-oriented data handling and contractual controls.
- SOC 2 Type II style control alignment (where applicable to service scope).
- Ongoing security verification practices (e.g., monitoring and periodic testing).

> Note: formal certifications/attestations are scope- and time-dependent. For procurement reviews, request the latest official reports from the security team.

## 10) Threat scenarios and mitigations

### Unauthorized data access

Mitigations:

- RBAC + least privilege,
- tenant/workspace boundaries,
- event logging and alerting.

### Data interception

Mitigations:

- TLS 1.3 transport security,
- hardened network/service communication.

### Data tampering

Mitigations:

- controlled write paths,
- audit chains and integrity-oriented logging,
- restricted high-risk operations.

### Operational outages

Mitigations:

- monitored workloads,
- retry/recovery patterns,
- backup/restore procedures.

## 11) Frontend visibility: how architecture is communicated

The public security experience should present controls in a way that is both credible and easy to verify.

Recommended presentation structure:

- **Trust cards**: GDPR, encryption, EU residency, SOC 2, RBAC, audit trail.
- **Architecture section**: concise multi-layer model (edge, identity, app, data, ops).
- **Factsheet CTA**: direct route to this document for security reviewers.
- **Clear hierarchy**: headline -> proof points -> architecture -> governance details.

UX requirements:

- responsive on mobile/desktop,
- readable spacing and contrast,
- reduced-motion friendly animation behavior,
- keyboard-accessible navigation and links.
