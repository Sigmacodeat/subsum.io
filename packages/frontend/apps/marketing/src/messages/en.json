    "faq1Q": "Can I switch plans at any time?",
    "faq1A": "Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade at any time. When upgrading, you get immediate access to all new features. When downgrading, changes take effect at the end of your billing cycle. We always prorate charges fairly.",
    "faq2Q": "What happens after the 14-day free trial?",
    "faq2A": "After your trial, choose a paid plan to keep full access. If you don't subscribe, your account shifts to a limited free workspace so you can continue and upgrade when needed — no data is deleted.",
    "faq3Q": "How does the pages/month limit work?",
    "faq3A": "Each page of a document counts as one page toward your monthly limit. Multi-page PDFs count each page individually. Unused pages don't roll over, but you can always purchase add-on page packs if you need a burst of extra capacity.",
    "faq4Q": "What counts as a 'user seat'?",
    "faq4A": "Each person who logs into Subsumio needs their own user seat. Seats can be reassigned at any time — if someone leaves, simply transfer their seat to a new team member at no additional cost.",
    "faq5Q": "Do you offer discounts for non-profits or legal aid?",
    "faq5A": "Yes! We offer 50% off all plans for non-profit legal organizations, legal aid clinics, and pro-bono practices. Contact our sales team with proof of non-profit status to get started.",
    "faq6Q": "Is there a setup fee or long-term contract?",
    "faq6A": "No setup fees and no long-term commitments. All plans are month-to-month (or annual with 20% savings). You can cancel at any time — we believe in earning your business every month.",
    "faq7Q": "Can I try the full platform before committing?",
    "faq7A": "Absolutely. Every plan starts with a 14-day reverse trial: full premium access first, then a guided transition to a limited free workspace unless you upgrade. No credit card required to start.",
    "faq8Q": "How secure is my data? Can I self-host?",
    "faq8A": "All data is encrypted end-to-end (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit) and stored exclusively in EU data centers. Our zero-knowledge architecture means we can never access your documents. Enterprise plans include a full self-hosted option for maximum data sovereignty.",

    "faq10Q": "What happens if we run out of AI Credits?",
