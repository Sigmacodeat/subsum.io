# Upload & ingest

This article explains what happens after you upload a file — from OCR to searchable semantic chunks.

## What happens on upload

1. The file is validated (type, size, basic integrity).
2. If needed, OCR is applied to scanned pages.
3. Text is extracted and normalized.
4. The content is chunked into semantic sections.

## Semantic chunks

Semantic chunks are the building blocks for fast, precise retrieval:

- They keep context (not just keywords)
- They make search and AI analysis auditable
- They allow pinpoint citations back to the source

## Best practices

- Prefer text-based PDFs when possible.
- If you upload scans, use 300 DPI and high contrast.
- Avoid heavy image compression.
