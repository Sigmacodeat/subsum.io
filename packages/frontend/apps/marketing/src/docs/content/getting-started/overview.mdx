# Overview

Subsumio is an AI-powered platform for legal teams that turns documents into structured, searchable knowledge — with auditability and production-grade workflows.

## Who it is for

Subsumio is designed for:

- Law firms
- In-house legal teams
- Tax/legal operations teams

## What you can do

- Upload documents (including scans)
- Extract text via OCR
- Automatically generate searchable semantic chunks
- Search across your matter/case knowledge base

## How the platform is structured

Subsumio follows a simple flow:

1. Intake (upload + normalization)
2. Extraction (OCR + parsing)
3. Indexing (semantic chunks)
4. Retrieval (search + references)
5. Workflows (case work, drafting, deadlines)
